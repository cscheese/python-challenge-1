### Brief Description of Challenge 
>This weeks challenge uses the setting of a Food Truck with the need to set up an interactive ordering system. A menu file was adapted to allow customers to place an order, which includes requesting an input and storing the customer's order, and printing the receipt with the total price of all chosen items.(1)

### Resources Used

Some of this code was created by following along with the course instructor as he demonstrated how to complete the homework by copying and pasting code from course examples and activites. [_Lecture Programming for AI: Part 1 III (June 10, 2024)._](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/6443/pages/2-programming-for-ai-part-1?module_item_id=1276984)

I worked extensively on this challenge. Resources included: reviewing and going through the class activities and homework, before class tutoring, Xpert Learning Assistant (helpful), some help from ChatGPT 4, but honestly it mostly was not incredibly helpful, I also connected with ASK BCS Learning, which was helpful and a tutoring session - where I learned a LOT!.
All these resources were incredibly helpful.
